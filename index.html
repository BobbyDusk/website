      <p>Hi, my name is Bobby Dusk.</p>
	    <p>I am a programmer. I do front-end stuff with javascript (Svelte, Vite, Rollup, etc.) as well as back-end stuff and general scripting with Python (uv, flask, pandas, sql-alchemy, etc.)</p>
      <p>I enjoy mucking about with networks. In my home lab, I am running OPNsense as the router as well as a NAS with Open Media Vault. It also runs plex, pi-hole and some other docker containers.</p>
      <p>Togher with my sister <a href="https://www.bluefernarts.com/">Annemieke</a>, we're running a game-development studio called <a href="https://edgeofdusk.com/">Edge of Dusk</a>. We create small games with a focus on story and art. My sister creates the art, while I do the programming.</p>
      <p>In my free time, I enjoy walking and playing with our dog, watching movies and painting / drawing. I used to dance ballroom competitively.</p>
